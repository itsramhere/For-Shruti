            <cite> Dear pumpkin, </cite> <br> <br> I hope you're doing well. Actually, I kinda know 
            that you're doing well 'cause you opened this page - meaning you're happy, yippee!! I know 
            that you have a million problems everyday, and that sometimes being happy and finding
            reasons to be happy is difficult too - but you are today and isn't that something to 
            celebrate??? <br> <br>
            I hope you're telling me everything about your day so far - why you're happy and celebrating
            and shaking that pumpkin ass of yours hehe. <br>
            I am incredibly glad that you are happy, because you have the prettiest smile in the whole 
            wide world. Not just that, the way your cheeks glow and your eyebrows curve when you laugh
            gives me a joy I cannot describe. <br><br> 
            I hope that you've told me all about your amazing day and experiences, and I absolutely 
            cannot wait to bump asses with you like we're little kids dancing when I hear the deets 
            why you're so incredibly pumpkin and angelic!! <br><br><br>

            Signing off, <br> Yours only, <br> Ram &#129505;
