                 For when you're mad at me
           </h2>

         <p>
        Hi, to the most beautiful woman of them all.  
        I am <strong>SO SO SORRY</strong> for whatever I did to get you mad.  I know that
        you are NOT the type who gets mad unnecessarily or stupidly, in my experience you have always
        gotten mad only when I have done something wrong. So it is fair of me to only begin by asking
        you an apology.

        Next, I want you to get on our DMs and text me first. It doesn't matter how mad you are and how
        big your rant is. I always want to hear it, and I always want to know it. So tell me - without
        hesitating what it is that I did. That is all I can implore you to do here because apologising 
        and communicating and telling my side of the story is the only thing I can do. So please go ahead
        and tell me everything about it, and I promise I will do my best to communicate too. 
        <br> I love you, mwah &lt;3

                For when you're mad at others

            <p>
                If it'll cheer you up, I just spent almost 20 minutes looking for a meme template, then realised it has absolutely nothing to do with this situation. See, I know that others will be stupid just like me at <br> times and that you can't really control their dumbness, but you know what you can do? Be a gentlewoman <br> and kill them with kindness. I know that it seems really stupid, but trust me - you are so incredibly <br> kind and loving that it was one of the first things that made me fall for you my love. You are a superhero, and this is one of your biggest strengths. I know that you will scoff at it, but trust me on this - I am dead serious right now. Your kindness and love and thoughtfulness are among the things that made me go gaga and head over heels for you. I am really always proud to be dating someone as amazing as you, and I mean it. So please, forgive the idiot who made you angry and tell me all about it so that we can both bitch about that fool together. <br> I love you, my kind and caring pumpkin. Mwah. &lt;3
